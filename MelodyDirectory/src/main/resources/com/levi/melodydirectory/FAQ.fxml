By peering through the Top Rated and Recently &#10;    added sliders, we hope you might find something new that you can enjoy.&#10;&#10;Q: Can I search for specific songs and artists I like?&#10;A: Of course! There is a search bar in the top right that allows you to search for a specific song or artist. Enter any term you &#10;     like and let us take care of the rest.&#10;&#10;Q: I get I can search for songs I already know, but how do I find completely new songs?&#10;A: When you search for a song you already know and look at the detailed view of it, there is a section at the bottom &#10;    which suggests new content from the same album, artist, or genre. Now you have ten times as many songs to listen to!&#10;&#10;Q: Why can't I leave comments?&#10;A: You can, however you must first login or create an account. To login, start at the homepage and select &#10;    Login -&gt; New User? then fill out all the required fields. Once logged in you can leave as many comments as you like!" wrapText="true" VBox.vgrow="ALWAYS" />
